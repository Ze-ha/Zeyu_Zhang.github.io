    <h1>Hi, I'm Zeyu Zhang!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my personal website. I am currently studying Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences at Duke Kunshan University and Duke University.</p>
    <img src="selfpic.jpg" alt="My Photo" style="width:200px; border-radius:50%;">

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am passionate about mathematics, computer science, and building real-world applications using data and algorithms. 
        I love learning new technologies and challenging myself with projects that solve meaningful problems.<br>
	<br>

	At times, I find myself reflecting on the meaning of life—a question I have long struggled to answer, and still do. 
	While I haven’t found a clear solution, I believe the pursuit of knowledge, the process of understanding complexity, 
	and the hope of contributing something meaningful to others offer partial answers. It is this uncertainty, rather than clarity, that often motivates me to keep learning.
